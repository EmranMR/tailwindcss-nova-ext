## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this extension, other than Panic's Nova code editor for macOS.

## Usage

Enable the extension in the extension library within Nova. The extension can be toggled on/off at any time using the "Toggle TailwindCSS" command available in the command palette.

## Configuration

The extension does not require a local installation of Tailwind, therefore, it will also function when using Tailwind via CDN.

The Tailwind CSS extension will always provide default Tailwind CSS classes. However, for projects where Tailwind has been customized, the extension will perform these these actions in order:
1. Attempt to read the Tailwind configuration file specified in the workspace preferences (*see screenshot below*).
2. Search the workspace for a 'tailwind.config.js' file and attempt to read it.

**As of version 4.1, the extension only supports customized extended colors. Support for additional customizations is planned.**

It is not necessary to include a Tailwind installation in the project, nor include a 'tailwind.config.js' file for default class suggestions.

### Workspace Configuration
To specify a Tailwind configuration file, go to the workspace preferences, select Tailwind CSS, and choose a file. Simply delete the path if you wish to for the extension to automatically find and include the 'tailwind.config.js' file again.

## Planned Future Features

* Improved support for Tailwind CSS customization.
